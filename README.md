pAInful Resource pack:

what up minecrafter friends! Right now im talking to noone! 
Just set up this GIT so I can try to find some help completing this Resource pack.  

Today I also just discovered that a new game called Hytale is being developed by the creators of the Minecraft server HyPixel.
Its basically a minecraft clone but with modding capabilities and tools built right into the game from the start.  No third party frameworks required.  
That being said, this project might turn into a pack that is compatible for both. 
Its not even in Beta yet so nothing to worry about at this moment.

This pack is a 512 texture pack themed around realism but with the goal of being fun, unique, and creative.  
The AI in pAInful is an indication that yes I use AI for the artwork and anything else I can save time with.

Mostly I have been using Midjourney because it can generate seamless tiles very well using --tile --ar 1:1 at the end of your prompt.

Here is a template prompt thats close to what I have been using so far.

8k National Geographic award winning realistic photo, of <name of texture with description> --no <negative prompt> --tile --ar 1:1 

Feel free to use whatever you want however you want. 
Other tools I use are Photoshop, Texture Forge (plugin and animator), and Comfy UI.  

Thats all for now. 
Thank you for your help.
